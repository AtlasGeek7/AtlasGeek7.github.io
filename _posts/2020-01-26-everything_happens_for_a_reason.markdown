Since childhood, I've always had a passion for science and technology in general, and computers in particular. It all started the day I held that old gameboy in my hand for the first time in my life. It was instantly fascinating. 
Think back to the first video game you played. It was probably mesmerizing to think about how the game worked. It responded to your whims through a set of clear and easy-to-use interactions. It pulled you into its story by giving you a window into its world and a way of interacting with — shaping, even — that world. Programming means that you can create such a world for other people. Sure, it'll be a while before you're ready to build something like , Tomb Raider, Angry Birds, or even a simple Tic Tac Toe game, but we can start with small steps.

So, soon after starting the 11th grade, which was a Mathematical Sciences one, I was already coding my first "computer" programs on that precious Casio FC-1000 that my father bought for me. I was able to build a few "apps" and even a few games (Number Puzzle Game, Ping-Pong). I learned the coding language by reading the calculator's manual. That was back when I was still living in Morocco.

Fast-forwarding to the late 2000s, I was able to build a PC application for my brother, who needed some work automation, using my self-taught Visual Basic skills. 

When I came to America, the language barrier was one of the first obstacles I had to deal with during my journey in the New World. It was quite a challenging situation for someone like me, who was already speaking two other languages, but I was determined to face and overcome it. Luckily, I have always been good at learning new languages.

Nowadays, I work part-time as a freelancer/bike courier. I make decent money, but I still feel like something is missing in my life. Every time I use one of those delivery apps while working, I can't help but think about its technical aspect... Like, how the UI, the database, and server-side technology are utilized in conjunction with each other to dynamically create a great delivery experience for all its users, and about how I could have been one of the software engineers who built something that sophisticated and that useful.

Becoming a professional software engineer has always been the dream of my life since the day I first played that simple game on that old gameboy, and that was something that happened a long time ago. But my fascination with science and knowledge, in general, and with technology and computers specifically has turned into a passion that has  never diminished since then.

I still believe that coding can be my actual career path. I know it's a doable goal because, even nowadays, the fire of my passion still burns so bright, and my obsession with problem-solving keeps me awake in bed sometimes. I still feel like I was born to be a software engineer.
That's why I would like to finally fulfill my American Dream by becoming a professional Software Engineer, and I believe that this prestigious, priceless bootcamp program called Flatiron School is the  way to go. And that, in a nutshell, is the story of my life.
