Someone once said: "I think everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer, should learn a computer language, because it teaches you how to think." That someone was one of the greatest thinkers and great minds of our time, aka Steve Jobs. That pretty much sums is it. And "Great minds think alike" indeed.

Coding teaches discipline - a logical, rational thought process. And program code is just a way of expressing ideas to a computer. Everyone needs this skill, many think they have it, most don’t. I would teach code to my kids for this reason alone. People who have never developed strong analytic skills usually end up as victims in life.
Code is everywhere - we live in age of machines and technology. If you can code you are empowered. And if you only take the time to think about it, you'd probably end up realizing that this entire universe is nothing but a program, a very complex one, that was coded by the Greatest Coder of them all... Really!
Just think of the similarities between a software programming concept like a class and us as human beings, and try to draw an analogy between the human DNA, which is sort of a blueprint/factory, and something like this:

Coding can also teach us how to:
  • think for ourselves
  • try many different approaches
  • tackle big problems one step at a time
  • co-operate and learn from others
  • embrace failure as a normal result of a complex process like "doing something new"
  • understand structures and relationships
  • be patient and never give up too easily
  • ask for help when we need it
  • be proud of our accomplishments and what we build

These days, learning the basic of coding is akin to basic literacy. It may be, in time, that computers are sophisticated enough we don’t require programmers. In which case coding may become an anachronism; but that hasn’t happened yet. Judging by the slow progress we are making on true AI, I’d say that day is at least 20 years away; and until that day arrives, coding remains a relevant life skill.
