Due to a sudden, prolonged sickness, project week #2 did not start quite well for me... Not exactly the kind of scenario I was hoping for. However, it turned out to be so much fun, especially considering how basic the first one, aka CLI, was.

My Sinatra App is called PetVet and it's meant for the clients and the employees of an imaginary veterinary clinic as two portals where they could:

* Sign up and sign in
* Create a client/pet profile
* Edit pet info
* Upload client/pet photos
* Add/delete pets
* Display all the data
* Write, read, and/or delete a review
* Book, confirm or cancel an appointment
* Enter doctor prescription
* See all current appointments
* Use live chat

It's an MVC app that utilizes many different front-end (JS, Ajax, jQuery) and back-end technologies (Ruby/Sinatra) to deliver a rather decent user experience. All those tasks could be performed thanks to Active Record' s CRUD operations. 

To be honest, I am very proud of this milestone accomplishment of mine regardless. And of couse I am looking forward to adding more features to it and enhancing the overall user experience by either using Sinatra or Rails...
