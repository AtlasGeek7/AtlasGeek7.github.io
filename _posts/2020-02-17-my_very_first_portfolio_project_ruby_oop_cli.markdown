Hello and welcome to Zik App: my first Ruby CLI application. This is also my very first portfolio project as a Flatiron Bootcamp student. It uses Ruby OOP and Nokogiri/Open-URI gems for the purpose of scraping a website in search of some music list info. The website link is: [***Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time***](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-151127/?list_page=10#list-item-50)

The app displays 50 songs of their top-500 list of the greatest songs in history. Songs can be displayed in one whole list or searched by title, band, or rank.

Hopefully you find this info about this basic app of mine kind of useful. Thanks for visiting!
